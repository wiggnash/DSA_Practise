# Palindrome and Anagrams Notes

## Palindrome

### Permutations of Strings

1. Reordering of the given string is called permutations

### Palindrom

#### Palindrom of Even Length

1. Whenever we are fixing a character from first , the correspoding last chracter is also fixed , which means these characters are
   occuring in pairs
2. Therefore if the characters in the string is occuring even number of times , then it means it can make a palindrome

#### Palindrom of Odd Length

1. Only one character can occur odd number of times or Atmost one character can occur odd number of times

## Anagrams

1. Anagram of a string is another string that contains the same character , only the order of the characters can be different
2. Permutations and Anagram are same ? Usally Anagram string have to have some meaning to it , but here we will consider permuataions and anagram is the same , Permutations can be any ordering of a character without needing to have meaning
